description: >
    This is the directory header required by all dat files.
    it contains information about the subject as well as a set of 
    dataset headers. 
    These dataset headers determine what schema to use when parsing them.


schema:
    -   name: animal id
        type: str
        length: 12
        comment: subject associated with the file
    -   name: number of datasets
        type: int
        comment: this determines how many dset headers there will be at the end.
    -   name: number of blocks in directory
        type: int
        comment: there may be empty ones before the first dataset usually bigger than needs be
    -   name: unused
        type: str
        length: 4
    -   name: last updated
        type: str
        length: 8
        comment: last time file was updated. not used.
    -   name: unused
        type: str
        length: 32
    -   name: dataset header
        type: rg
        length: number of datasets

            this is how many dataset headers there are. 
            they are contiguous. However there's a break 
            before the end of the directory usually
        scheme:
            -   name: name
                length: 8
                comment: name of the scheme the dataset uses
                type: str
            -   name: size
                type: int
                comment: dataset size in blocks
            -   name: id
                type: str
                length: 12
                comment: subject/test id. 
            -   name: start
                type: int
                comment: block number where dataset starts
            -   name: exp
                type: str
                length: 4
                comment: experiment type. e.g. Populin uses COM
